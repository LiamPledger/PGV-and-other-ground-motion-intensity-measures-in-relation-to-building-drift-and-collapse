Run the code and plots should be produced and saved in the \Plots folder.

The excel file "log_std_and_cov_scaled_IMs.xlsx" lists the log-normal standard deviation
and the coefficient of variation (std/mean for linear space) for each intensity measure for each model. 

These results are used to quantify the "efficiency" of the different ground motion intensity measures.
